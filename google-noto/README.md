## Notes

- The [pride flag](pride_flag.svg) is provided for completeness despite being already included in the Noto Emoji set.
- Flags are most directly derived from the Rainbow Flag (1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308) emoji.
- Hearts are most directly derived from the Heart (2764) emoji. The gradient stops were interpreted as translucent grayscale over pure bright red (#f00), then applied atop flat flag patterns. The border of the heart was used as a clipping mask. Flags were scaled to match the height from the tip of the heart to the top of the heart's round blobs.
- Following the relatively dark red in the Heart emoji, the hearts ended up quite dark relative to the flags.
- Non-striped patterns are not yet done.
