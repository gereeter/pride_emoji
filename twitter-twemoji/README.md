## Notes

- The [pride flag](pride_flag.svg) and [trans flag](trans_flag.svg) are provided for completeness despite being already included in the Twemoji set.
- Flags follow Twemoji's standard flag shape of a 36x26 vertically-centered rectangle with radius-4 rounded corners. Stripes are scaled as appropriate to fit the height.
- Flags are most directly derived from the Transgender Flag (1f3f3-fe0f-200d-26a7-fe0f) emoji with the imperfect pink rectangles fixed.
- Hearts are modeled after the Heart (2764) emoji. Flags are scaled to fit approximate vertical bounds of the icon (y from 1.95 to 34.035), then clipped to the outline of the heart.
- The demisexual flag is most directly derived from the Czech Flag (1f1e8-1f1ff) emoji for its geometric simplicity. This follows Twemoji's pattern of exaggerating the triange to bring its point closer to the center of the image (x to 17.5).
- The demisexual heart matches the demisexual flag in triangle slope.
- All whites are represented as #EEE following Twemoji's base Transgender Flag emoji.
