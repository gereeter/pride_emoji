A collection of high-quality variants of standard emoji sets providing flags and hearts patterned according to flags flown by communities formed around gender, sex, and sexuality.

## Notes

- The rainbow flag is standardized in Unicode as 1f3f3-fe0f-200d-1f308 (🏳️‍🌈), and the trans flag is slated for standardization in Emoji 13.0 as 1f3f3-fe0f-200d-26a7-fe0f (🏳️‍⚧️). However, they are both included for completeness.
- Color schemes and flag designs are taken from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_symbols#LGBT_pride_flags>.
- Choice of lesbian flag is somewhat controversial. This repository currently contains patterns according to the 5-stripe community flag and the lipstick flag (with no lips). Labrys flag designs may come later. The 7-stripe community design seems to be a largely aesthetic difference, and flags are often simplified for clarity in emoji, but if desired it can be straightforwardly added.
